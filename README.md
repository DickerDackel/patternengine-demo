# patternengine-demo

Demo showcasing many patterns from the patternengine project

# Installation

You are using virtual envs, aren't you?  AREN'T YOU?

I pull in a lot of shit that might have a yet unstable API, so don't ruin your
main python install.

```
python -m venv patternengine-demo
cd patternengine-demo

Scripts/activate.bat
# or on linux
# source ./bin/activate

pip install git+https://github.com/dickerdackel/patternengine-demo

patternengine-demo
```
